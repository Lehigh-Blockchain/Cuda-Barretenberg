# Implementation Plan
- [x] Set up a cloud infrastructure (NVIDIA A10 (Ampere) w/ 24 GB VRAM) on Oracle Cloud
- [x] Initialize Barretenberg repo
- [x] Integrate cuda-fixnum external library and add cuda / nvcc support
- [ ] Implement FF operations on the GPU
    - [ ] Implement montogomery multiplication for GPU
        - [x] Understand the algorithm, and the difference between montogomery multiplication and montogomery reduction schemes
        - [x] Extract the montogomery multiplication function to a seperate benchmarking file and get it compiling
        - [x] Understand Barretenberg's C++ implementation, and benchmark for correctness and performance
        - [ ] Compare against cuda-fixnum's montogomery multiplication (CIOS) implementation
    - [ ] Implement addition/subtraction operations on GPU
    - [ ] Understand other logic for the BN-254 EC (fq.test.cpp, fq.hpp, field.hpp, and field_impl.hpp)
    - [ ] Implement equivalent logic for GPU using cuda-fixnum library
